features:
  - |
    A density matrix representation of the state can be accessed via the ``Circuit.density_matrix``
    property, for both pure and mixed states (with the former being lazily calculated from the state
    vector).

upgrade:
  - |
    The state is now stored in the ``Circuit`` object (same as the bits/measurement results) instead
    of being returned by the ``simulate()`` function. It can now be accessed via the
    ``Circuit.state`` property.
