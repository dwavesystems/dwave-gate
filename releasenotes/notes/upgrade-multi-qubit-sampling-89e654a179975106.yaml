upgrade:
  - |
    Adds support for multi-qubit sampling in measurements. ``Measurement.sample()`` and
    ``Measurement.expval()`` are updated to accept a sequence of qubit indices to sample, sampling
    all measured qubits if none are given.

    .. code-block:: python

      circuit = Circuit(2, 2)

      with circuit.context as (q, c):
          ops.X(q[0])
          m = ops.Measurement(q) | c

      simulate(circuit)

      m.sample(num_samples=3, as_bitstring=True)
      # ['10', '10', '10']

features:
  - Measurement samples can be returned as bitstrings instead of integers in nested lists.
