    Upgrade circuit call to accept classical bits in which to store measurement values. If no bits
    are passed to the circuit call, measurements will not be stored when circuit is simulated.

    .. code-block:: python

      circuit = Circuit(2, 2)

      with circuit.context as (q, c):
          ops.Hadamard(q[0])
          ops.Hadamard(q[1])
          ops.Measurement(q) | c

      circuit_2 = Circuit(2, 2)

      with circuit_2.context as (q, c):
          circuit(q, c)  # pass bits to 'circuit'
